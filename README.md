# VEED Video Library Dashboard

A full-stack application to browse, sort, and manage your video library. Built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, daisyUI, and Node.js + Express backend.

---

## üöÄ Introduction
This project is a take-home engineering challenge for VEED. It demonstrates a modern, modular, and well-typed approach to building a video library dashboard with a focus on code quality, UX, and maintainability.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd veed.io-project
```

### 2. Install dependencies (Frontend)
```bash
cd frontend
nvm use v20 # or install Node.js v20 LTS
npm install
```

### 3. Run the frontend app
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### 4. Install dependencies (Backend)
```bash
cd ../backend
nvm use v20 # or install Node.js v20 LTS
npm install
```

### 5. Run the backend API server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The API will be available at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

- On first run, the backend will automatically create a SQLite database in `backend/data/videos.db` and seed it with data from `backend/videos.json` if the table is empty.
- No manual migration or seeding steps are required.

## üì¶ Packages Used
- **React**: UI library
- **Vite**: Fast dev/build tool
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **daisyUI**: Pre-styled Tailwind components
- **React Router**: Routing (`/`, `/new`)
- **Express**: Backend API
- **better-sqlite3**: SQLite database
- **CORS, body-parser**: Middleware for API

---

## ‚ú® Features Implemented
- Frontend scaffolded with Vite + React + TS
- Tailwind CSS and daisyUI configured (v3.4.3)
- React Router with `/` and `/new` routes
- Favicon and meta tags set up
- Modular page structure
- Backend API and database setup with auto-seeding
- **GET /api/videos** endpoint implemented (Express v4, TypeScript, zod validation, error handling)
- Responsive, flicker-free layout with fixed nav bar and smooth fade transitions for sorting
- All layout, spacing, and polish handled by Tailwind CSS and daisyUI utility classes

---

## üõ°Ô∏è API Endpoints

### `GET /api/videos`
- Returns a list of all videos from the SQLite database
- Supports optional `?sort=asc|desc` query parameter (default: newest first)
- Returns: Array of video objects with fields: `id`, `title`, `thumbnail_url`, `created_at`, `duration`, `views`, `tags`
- Input validated with zod; errors return 400 with JSON error message
- All errors are handled with proper status codes and JSON responses

---

## üìù Next Steps
- Backend API endpoints (`GET /api/videos`, `POST /api/videos`)
- Video grid and form implementation
- API integration
- Testing (Vitest, React Testing Library)
- Further UI/UX improvements

## üß™ Testing & Monorepo Note

Tests for backend and frontend are kept inside their respective package folders (e.g., `backend/tests/`, `frontend/tests/`).

> **Note:** For larger or more complex monorepos, tools like Yarn Workspaces, pnpm, or Turborepo can be used to centralize dependencies and test runs. In this project, we intentionally keep the structure lean and simple, with each package managing its own dependencies, scripts, and tests for maximum clarity and minimal overhead.

> **Frontend Testing Note:**
> React Testing Library tests for the video grid and UI states could be implemented (e.g., loading, error, empty, and normal states), but are omitted here due to time constraints for the take-home challenge.

## üß™ Running Backend Tests

To run backend API tests:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if not already done):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the tests (runs once and exits):
   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```

- Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) for fast, robust API testing.
- No need to start the backend server manually; tests import the Express app directly.

> **Backend tests use an in-memory SQLite database, seeded from videos.json before each test. This ensures test isolation and prevents test data from polluting production. The production DB is auto-seeded if missing or empty.**
